This is a Python-based payment processing application that integrates Stripe for handling secure online transactions. It uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Flask for the backend to handle Stripe webhooks.

Features
Secure payment form using Stripe API.
Real-time payment processing with validation for card details.
Flask backend for webhook integration.
Tkinter GUI for a user-friendly payment interface.
Simulates a complete payment workflow with Stripe's test mode.

Test Payments:

Use Stripe's test card numbers:
Card Number: 4242424242424242
Expiry Date: Any future date (MM/YY)
CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
Usage
Launch the application.
Fill in the payment details in the Tkinter GUI:
Card Number: Enter a valid card number.
Expiry Date: Use the format MM/YY.
CVC: Enter a 3- or 4-digit security code.
Click "Pay Now" to process the payment.
Check the console for payment intent creation and webhook logs.
Key Components
Frontend (Tkinter GUI)
Provides a simple interface for users to enter payment details.
Handles client-side validation for card numbers, expiry dates, and CVC.
Backend (Flask)
Processes payment intents using the Stripe API.
Handles Stripe webhooks for payment confirmation.
Testing
Simulate Payments:
Use Stripe's test mode to simulate various payment scenarios.
Validate Inputs:
Test invalid card numbers, expired dates, or incorrect CVC to ensure proper error handling.
Future Improvements
Add email receipt functionality.
Support for additional payment methods (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay).
Deploy the application for public use on platforms like AWS or Heroku.
Enhance the GUI with animations and improved design.
